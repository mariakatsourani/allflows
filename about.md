### Work Experience

*Mojang (2017-now)*

At Mojang I have the opportunity to expand and maintain [Minecraft's website](https://minecraft.net). This is the place where players can buy the game, manage their account, read articles and find information about updates, events etc.


*Spotify (2016-2017)*

At Spotify I initially developed a series of static pages that are part of [spotify.com](https://spotify.com). Those try to educate users on how to use Spotify Connect with different devices.

Afterwards I moved to a new team where I worked on the new [Spotify for Developers website](https://developer.spotify.com/). The goal was to create an easier to maintain and more intuitive website that would help developers find their way through documentation easily.


*KFUM Central (2016)* 

KFUM Central employed me to help with the development of their new web presence based on WordPress. Besides development I was also involved in design process.


*Trainee at Chas (2015-2016)*

While being a trainee at Chas Visual Management I worked on both internal as well as customer facing projects. These projects were mainly company sites, administration tools and business intelligence tools.
