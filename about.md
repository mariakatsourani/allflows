### Work Experience

*Mojang (2017-now)*

At Mojang I have the opportunity to expand and maintain [Minecraft's website](minecraft.net), where you can buy the game as well as find educational and entertaining content.


*Spotify (2016-2017)*

Spotify initially hired me to develop a series of static pages that would become a part of spotify.com. Those pages would provide users with the instructions needed on how to use Spotify in different contexts.

After the above assignment I moved to a new team where I worked on the new [Spotify for Developers website](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/). The goal was to create an easier to maintain and a more intuitive website that would help developers find their way through documentation easily.


*KFUM Central (2016)* 

KFUM Central employed me to help with the development of their new webpage created on WordPress. Besides development I was also involved in design process.


*Trainee at Chas (2015-2016)*

While being a trainee at Chas Visual Management I worked on both internal as well as customer facing projects. These were company sites, administration tools and business tools.
