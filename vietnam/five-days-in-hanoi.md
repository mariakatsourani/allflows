Hanoi being the capital of Vietnam is big and busy and touristic. Most hotels are located in the Old Quarter, which is obviously where all the tourists are as well. There are hotels out in the “real” city as well but it will probably be hard to communicate with the staff. Old town offers some great museums and other places where you can learn about Vietnam's history and a lot of typical touristy activities to enjoy like shopping and nice restaurants.

One of the biggest dangers when in Vietnam is the traffic. Since everyone drives with no respect for each other even things like crossing the road can be quite challenging when you‘re used to western traffic standards. Make sure you are aware of what is happening around you constantly, because you can’t even be sure that you won’t get run over when you’re walking on the sidewalk. Also make no sudden moves while crossing the road, the traffic will most probably dodge you. If on the other hand you are driving then remember that no matter how cautious you are the vietnamese driving style is very different from the western, so try to adjust to theirs as much as possible without driving as carelessly.

Getting ripped off isn’t anything unexpected in the touristic parts of any city. But getting ripped off in exchange for fakes and bad quality products is really not okay. There are a few things to keep in mind here. First all shops that advertise their products as made in Vietnam as not made in Vietnam but China! Second rule is that all western brands you see in local shops are not real! And you probably already knew that, but they are not factory seconds either as they might try to convince you. Also it goes without saying that none of these small shops -that sells exactly what the rest of the shops on the same street sell, have quality fabrics like silk, no matter what price they give you.

If you are not shopping in a chain store, chances are you bargain. A few things to consider about bargaining: 
*Do not give a very low starting price (less than ⅓ of their starting price) and make them feel disrespected.
*You should raise your price by small amounts, they won’t.
*When you want something make sure to appear a bit apathetic. If they sense that you are in need or that you're seriously considering to buy something then all chances of getting a good price are lost.
*If you think you‘re getting ripped off go the next store and do some research. (Usually all shops that sell similar products are next to each other on the same street.)
*Some vendors will state that they offer better quality than their neighbor. Not true!
*Just because it is a very fancy store it doesn’t mean it is worth the price. ([example](https://saigoneer.com/saigon-arts-culture/arts-culture-categories/11654-could-the-made-in-china-scandal-spell-the-end-for-khaisilk))
*If you want to buy good quality products train in recognising them beforehand. The sellers will most often demonstrate the quality of their products in various ways (like holding a lighter against leather), but you should be able to judge yourself.
*Thanking them and walking away usually works surprisingly well.

Hanoi gives you a lot of opportunities if you want to help others. One very easy way is to take a walk around the Hoàn Kiếm Lake on a Saturday or Sunday evening. Apart from the fact that you will see how the locals enjoy the weekend you can meet and talk to a lot of teenagers (mostly, but not only). They are out hunting for tourists that can help them practice their conversation skills and pronunciation. The kids usually have a script and they will bombard you with the questions once you agree to talk with them. You can though get some great insights about the culture and places to visit if you stray a bit from the questions and ask them your own.

I got really disappointed in people during the first days in Vietnam. It felt like everyone was trying to take advantage of me as if I only was worth as much money I had on me. Everyone seemed extremely selfish and respectless from the way they drive to the way they eat. But keep in mind that is is a very different culture and most importantly that people are hardy because they live much rougher lives than we do.
