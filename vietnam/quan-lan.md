A small strip of sand east of Hanoi.

There is white sand, sea shells and greenery. Plenty of beaches and homestays. Apparently this is a popular destination for domestic tourists since there are lots of homestays/restaurants for the size of the island but there is barely anyone that speaks English here.

We wanted to escape from the touristic buzz of Hanoi but this is the other extreme. We had to use translation apps to communicate even the simplest things. 

One English word that we really heard a lot though was hello. And it came from the mouths of really young children. More or less all the children that spotted us screamed “hellooooo” and in some occasions it was followed by a “what's your name??”. The children were probably the highlight of this island, they always looked so excited to see us and we even had the chance to interact with them at times.

The hotels there seemed to mostly cater to local tourists. Especially in the north the standard was quite low. The south end of the island was a bit more fancy but extremely dead. (At least during the low season when we were there). There were a handful of restaurants in Google maps with a few reviews but when we tried to visit it was usually a very deteriorated roof with a few chairs underneath but none there. 

The natural beauty of the island gave us hours of pure joy and relaxation. The Minh Châu beach on the south was very disappointing. We found a choped up animal spread on the beach a dead rat, a few jellyfish and a lot of garbage. This even though it was one of the highest rated beaches on the island was thankfully not the norm.

On the west side of the cetral part of the island we found a much cleaner beach that looked like you typical ad of a tropical beach wonderland. You can find all the sea shells, coarse white sand and peace of mind you want there. The most beautiful experience was to watch the tide lower. When the water lowered you could see small peninsulas of sand form and the ditches the water left in the sand while draining were spectacular. The setting sun brought the locals out on the beach where they started scratching the surface of the sand to reveal some sort of sea creature I suppose.
